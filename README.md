A Harry Potter themed text adventure for Adam Groce's Intro to Computer Science course taught Fall 2015 at Reed College.
I worked collaberatively with Alisa Kwok on this, and the work we each did is stated in the "improvements.md" file.

To play, navigate to the directory and run "main.1.py" in python (I think).
It's been some time since I worked on this, so I'm mainly just putting this here as part of my push to consolidate my work on GitHub.
