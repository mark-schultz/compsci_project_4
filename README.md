A Harry Potter themed text adventure for Adam Groce's Intro to Computer Science course taught Fall 2015 at Reed College.
I worked collaberatively with Alisa Kwok on this, and the work we each did is stated in the "improvements.md" file.

To play, navigate to the directory and run "main.py" in python.
